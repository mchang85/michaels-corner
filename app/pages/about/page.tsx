                        I fell in love with the world of art, media, and technology at an early age.
                        The way these mediums work together seamlessly to transport us into new worlds and settings is something I have always been inspired by.
                        From the charm of classic video games to the captivating narratives of feature films,
                        nothing beats the feeling of being fully immersed in the moment.

                        These passions have led me to explore paths in programming, ui/ux design, and more ways to create moments that leave lasting impressions.
                        I enjoy working at the bridge between creative and techinical fields, and am constantly seeking new tools, techniques, and ideas
                        to refine my skills and bring my visions to life.
