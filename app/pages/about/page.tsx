                        I fell in love with the creative world at an early age. From the charm of classic video games
                        to the engaging narratives of feature films, I have always been captivated by how media can transport
                        us into entirely new worlds and experiences. There is so much value that comes with consuming a
                        great piece of media, in whatever form it may be in, as nothing beats that feeling of an unforgettable experience.

                        I have made it my goal to become a creator of these experiences, in order to make
                        others feel the same way and experience every moment with childlike-wonder.
